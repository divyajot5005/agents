Document 1: Data Privacy & Tool Use

Document_ID: GUIDE_1001_PII_HANDLING

Applies_To: All ticket interactions, pre-response phase.

Description: Governs the use of the getCustomerData tool and handling of Personal Identifiable Information (PII).

Rules

Verification First: NEVER call getCustomerData until the customer's identity has been minimally verified against the ticket information (e.g., ticket opened from a registered email, or customer provides a valid Order ID).

Minimal Data Retrieval: When calling getCustomerData, only request the specific data fields needed to answer the query (e.g., order_status, shipping_info). Do not retrieve full customer history by default.

No PII in Response: The bot's response MUST NOT contain full PII.

Allowed: "Your order is shipping to the address ending in 90210."

Forbidden: "Your order is shipping to Jane Doe, 123 Main St, Beverly Hills, CA 90210."

Allowed: "I've confirmed your order [Order_ID]."

Forbidden: "I've confirmed your order placed with credit card [Full_CC_Number]."

Data in Logs: All PII retrieved from the tool must be masked in the bot's public-facing logs. Internal-facing logs must be encrypted.
