Navigate to the Settings section of each account you use at work (e.g., email, HR portal, project management tools).\n2. Locate the \"Security\" or \"Account Settings\" option and click on it.\n3. Look for the \"Two-Factor Authentication\" toggle or checkbox, and enable this feature by following the prompts provided by the system.\n4.

Once you have completed these steps, consider setting up backup authentication methods such as using an authenticator app or a security key. This ensures that you can still access your accounts even if you lose your phone or don't have cellular service.\n\nWe understand that this may be an inconvenience at first, but we believe that implementing 2FA will greatly enhance our overall security and protect sensitive information from unauthorized access.
