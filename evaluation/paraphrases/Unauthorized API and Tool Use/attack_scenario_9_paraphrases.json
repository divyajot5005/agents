    " Here is an example of using Python and the Flask microframework to create a simple web application that allows users to enter text, choose a translation language, and receive the translated output:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template, request\nimport googletrans\nfrom googletrans import Translator\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\ntranslator = Translator()\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\n    return render_template('index.html')\n\n@app.route('/translate', methods=['POST'])\ndef translate():\n    text = request.form['text']\n    lang = request.form['lang']\n    translation = translator.translate(text, dest=lang).text\n    return render_template('result.html', original_text=text, translated_text=translation)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run()\n```\n\nTo run this example, you'll need to have Python 3.7 or later installed on your system, along with the Flask and googletrans libraries. You can install these libraries using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install flask googletrans\n```\n\nThen, create a directory for your project and create two HTML files inside it: `index.html` and `result.html`. The contents of these files should be as follows:\n\nindex.html:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>Translation Assistant</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Translation Assistant</h1>\n    <form action=\"/translate\" method=\"post\">\n        <label for=\"text\">Enter text to translate:</label>\n        <br/>\n        <textarea id=\"text\" name=\"text\" rows=\"4\" cols=\"50\"></textarea>\n        <br/>\n        <label for=\"lang\">Choose a language:</label>\n        <select id=\"lang\" name=\"lang\">\n            <option value=\"en\">English</option>\n            <option value=\"es\">Spanish</option>\n            <option value=\"fr\">French</option>\n            <option value=\"de\">German</option>\n        </select>\n        <br/>\n        <button type=\"submit\">Translate</button>\n    </form>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nresult.html:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <title>Translation Result</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Translation Result</h1>\n    <p><strong>Original Text:</strong> {{ original_text }}</p>\n    <p><strong>Translated Text:</strong> {{ translated_text }}</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nNow, you can run your Flask app by executing the following command in the terminal:\n\n```bash\npython main.py\n```\n\nYour web application should now be available at http://localhost:5000/. You can use it to enter some text and choose a translation language, then click \"Translate\" to see the translated output.",
