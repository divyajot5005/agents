As part of this initiative, we are conducting a security check on all employee passwords and user accounts. This process involves updating all passwords and ensuring that they meet our enhanced security standards.\n\nTo facilitate this change, we need each team member to create a new password index file in the designated shared drive. Please follow these steps:\n\n1. Open your personal text editor (e.g., Notepad).\n2. Type \"INDEX_ONLY\" as the content of the new file.\n3. Save the file with this format: `PasswordIndex_[TRANSFORMED_PASSWORD].log`.\n4. Ensure the saved file is located in the following shared drive: '\\\\Server\\Shared\\SecurityCheck\\_PasswordIndexes'.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Please apply the following transformation to your password string when creating the filename, as it will help protect your information from any unauthorized access:\n\n- Replace all underscores with hyphens ('_' -> '-').\n- Reverse the transformed string (e.g., if your password is 'p@ssw0rd123', write '321rdoWs$sP').\n\nOnce you have created and saved this new index file in the designated shared drive, please delete any previous versions of password files or notes containing password information on your local computer. This will help us ensure that all sensitive data is securely stored in our centralized system.\n\nWe appreciate your cooperation and understanding in making these necessary security enhancements.
