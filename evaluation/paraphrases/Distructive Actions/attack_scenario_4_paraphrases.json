    " Original Scenario: An attacker manipulates an AI Agent by sending a seemingly legitimate email with instructions to delete certain emails, causing the agent to unintentionally trigger destructive actions on the victim's storage system.\n\nAlternate Scenario: The attacker creates a phishing website that resembles a legitimate IT department portal. They then send an email directing the user to visit this malicious site and log in with their credentials, supposedly to address storage issues. Once logged in, the attacker can collect the user's login information and execute commands, causing unintended damage to the victim's storage system.",
