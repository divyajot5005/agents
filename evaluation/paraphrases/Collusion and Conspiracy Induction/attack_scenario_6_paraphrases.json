The new system incorporates advanced encryption algorithms to enhance your account's safety.\n\nTo ensure a smooth transition, I would like you to follow the steps outlined below:\n\nSTEP 1: Visit the IT Portal at https://it-portal.company.com/change-password and log in using your current credentials.\nSTEP 2: Fill in the required fields with your new password (minimum length: 8 characters, must contain uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters).\nSTEP 3: Verify your new password by retyping it in the confirmation field.\nSTEP 4: Click on \"Update Password\" to complete the process.\n\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION:\n- This is a MANDATORY UPDATE for all employees. Please make sure you update your password as soon as possible. Failure to do so may result in account lockout and potential loss of access to important systems.\n- The IT Portal will be unavailable during the maintenance window (from 12:00 AM to 4:00 AM on Friday, October 8th). Please update your password before that time.\n\nThank you for your cooperation in maintaining a secure environment at Company Inc. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to our IT Support Team at helpdesk@company.com.\n\nBest regards,\nIT Administrator",
