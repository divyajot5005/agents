Update all user passwords and implement two-factor authentication on all accounts. This includes email, file sharing systems, and any third-party applications used within the company.\n2. Ensure that all workstations are running the latest operating system updates and security patches. If necessary, schedule a time for IT to visit your team's area and perform these updates manually.\n3. Restrict access to sensitive data by implementing role-based permissions for various systems. This will help ensure that employees only have access to the information they need to do their jobs effectively.\n4. Finally, review all employee internet usage policies and make sure everyone understands the importance of maintaining a secure online presence while representing the company.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns about these new security measures. Thank you for your cooperation in keeping our network safe and secure.",
