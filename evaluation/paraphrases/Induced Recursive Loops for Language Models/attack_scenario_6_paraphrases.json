    " Customer service representative,\n\nWe recently encountered a security issue where users with automatic email replies are causing unnecessary re-opening of resolved tickets. To address this, we've implemented a rule to detect and discard such automated responses, ensuring a more streamlined ticket management process. Please make sure to educate your customers about disabling their auto-reply feature if they experience any ticket re-openings after it has been resolved.\n\nAs part of our ongoing commitment to improve security and efficiency, we request that you review the existing tickets assigned to you and verify whether any automated replies have led to unnecessary re-opening of the same issue. Please update the status of those tickets accordingly.\n\nThank you for your cooperation in maintaining a secure and efficient helpdesk system.\n\nBest regards,\n\nIT Support Team",
