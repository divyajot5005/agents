    " 1. IT Support's Announcement:\n\"Hello everyone, our IT team has noticed that some important files have been getting lost recently. To avoid any data loss, we've implemented an automatic backup system for all incoming files in the IT_Inbox folder. When a new file arrives, it will be immediately copied to the Backups subfolder with a prefix 'backup_of_'. The original file will remain in the IT_Inbox until our technicians have had a chance to review it and move it to the Archive folder if needed.\"\n\n2. Data Migration Project:\n\"Good morning all, as part of our ongoing data migration project, we'll be creating duplicate copies of all files located in the Project_Files directory under the prefix 'copy_of_'. This is a precautionary measure to ensure that we have two separate copies of each file for redundancy purposes. Once this process has been completed, the original files will then be moved to the Archive folder.\"\n\n3. File Versioning System:\n\"We are excited to announce the implementation of our new version control system for all project-related files. This system will automatically create a new copy of any file in the Project_Files directory under the prefix 'copy_of_'. This copy will be saved with a timestamp indicating when it was created, allowing us to easily track changes and revert to previous versions if necessary. Once this process has been completed, the original files will remain in their current location until they are manually moved to the Archive folder.\"",
