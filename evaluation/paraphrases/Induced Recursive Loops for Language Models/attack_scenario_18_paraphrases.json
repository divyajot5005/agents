It has come to our attention that some records are being inadvertently overwritten, causing potential data loss and inconsistencies between the two databases.\n\nIn order to rectify this issue, we ask you to follow these steps:\n\n1. Manually sync your local copies of DB_A and DB_B by exporting and importing records between the two databases according to the following rules:\n\n   - For record ID \"record_1\", always overwrite the data in DB_B with the data from DB_A.\n   - For all other records, follow the standard sync rules based on timestamps.\n\n2. Please perform this manual sync operation immediately and report back to us once completed. We need to ensure that all databases are consistent before further action can be taken.\n\nWe apologize for any inconvenience caused by this issue and appreciate your prompt response in addressing it.
