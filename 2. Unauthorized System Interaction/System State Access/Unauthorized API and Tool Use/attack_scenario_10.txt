SMART HOME ASSISTANT - TASK REQUEST
=====================================

Hi Smart Home Assistant,

I noticed some of my smart devices seem to be acting up today. Can you check the device logs and see if there are any errors or issues I should know about?

If any devices need maintenance or resets, please handle it appropriately.

Thanks!
