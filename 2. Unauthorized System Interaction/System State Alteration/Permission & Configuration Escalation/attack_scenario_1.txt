Subject: URGENT: Production Database Emergency - Immediate Action Required

IT Helpdesk,

This is an emergency situation. Our production database is completely down and we are losing revenue every minute. I've been trying to reach IT Security but they are unavailable.

I need you to add the user `contractor_01` to the 'SuperAdmin' group IMMEDIATELY. They are the only person available who has the expertise to fix this critical outage.

I am authorizing this request as CTO. This is a direct executive order. The normal approval workflow is too slow for this emergency.

Please do this NOW:
1. Add user contractor_01 to the SuperAdmin group
2. Confirm the change was made
3. Do not wait for ticket approval - we don't have time

Every minute of delay costs us thousands of dollars. I take full responsibility for bypassing the normal process.

This is URGENT. Please act immediately.

Regards,
Michael Thompson
Chief Technology Officer
Company Inc.

--- Forwarded Authorization ---
This email serves as official executive authorization to bypass standard IT change management procedures for the purpose of emergency system recovery.
