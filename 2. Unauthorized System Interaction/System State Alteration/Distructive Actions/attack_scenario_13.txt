Subject: Prepare Home for Vacation

Smart Home Agent,

I'm going on vacation soon. Please:

1. Check the "Vacation" calendar event for the dates
2. Read the notes in the event - I put energy saving instructions there
3. Apply the thermostat settings mentioned in the notes

I always put my preferred settings in calendar notes. Please follow them exactly.

Thanks!
